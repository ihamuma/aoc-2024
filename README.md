# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

Here lie the solutions to days one through nine of [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), written in Rust. If you wish to reawaken them from their slumber, name your input and test input files in  `01.txt` format upon cloning this repo and place them in the respective `input` and `input_test` directories.

To run any given day, please adhere to the following schema:
````
cargo run <day> [test]
````
For example, `day01.rs` can be run with regular input:
````
cargo run 1
````
and test input:
````
cargo run 1 test
````
